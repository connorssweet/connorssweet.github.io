            <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hello! I am Connor Sweet, a 1B Mechatronics Engineering student at
          the University of Waterloo. I am heavily interested in robotics,
          machine learning, and automation.</p>
        <p>I am also an avid volunteer in the Waterloo region, currently working
           under the honourable Bardish Chagger to improve the city's ecological
           footprint.</p>
        <p>When I'm not busy, I will often be found producing and performing
          electronic music, or putting a new idea into code.</p>
        <p>I am currently seeking a four month Co-op placement, from May to
           August.</p>

          <h2>RobotCMajor - Guitar Playing Robot</h2>
          <p>As a project for the end of my 1A Mechatronics term, I worked as part of a
            group of four to design, create, program and test a robot which is able to
            plot and strum power chords on an acoustic guitar.</p>
            <h4><a href="#hiddenproj0" data-toggle="collapse" id="hide">Click here to
              learn more</a></h4>
          <div id="hiddenproj0" class="collapse">
            <p>I took up a heavy role in the programming aspect of this robot, using
              multiple threads to optimize play time and improve sound quality. This
              also included writing driver tasks for each function created, to properly
              test the functionality and efficiency of the code.</p>
            <p>I also helped design the chassis for the robot, including a strumming arm
              and a gantry system allowing for 3 dimensional movement.Materials used for
              construction included wood, aluminum, and various Lego Mindstorms and
              Tetrix Robotics components.</p>
            <p>The robot was successfully able to plot the chords to and play "Smoke on
              the Water" by Deep Purple and "Free Fallin'" by Tom Petty by the project
              deadline. Both songs were sufficiently recognizable.
            </p>
            <p>RobotCMajor recieved a <strong>100%</strong> score in design and
            implementation.</p>
            <p>The code written during this project, including the test tasks, are
            all available on my GitHub account.</p>

          <h2>Line Following Music Player - Zero Robotics Competition</h2>
          <p>As a challenge presented to the UW Robotics Team, I worked alongside 3
            other students to design and develop a line following electromechanical
            system which outputs various frequencies based on the shade on a line
            interpreted by a colour sensor.</p>

            <p>As one of two Co-Presidents elected by the school's student body, I
              oversaw and managed the various divisions of the council, organized
              and facilitated school-wide events and presented speeches on important
              occasions, such as orientation day and the graduation ceremony.
              By leading a team of 30 students through interactive seminars, and
              constructing detailed plans for event preparation each day, I was
              able to adequately develop large scale events for the student body.
            </p>
            <p>As the Chair of the Media Production committee, I was in charge of
              producing a wide variety of multimedia advertisements for school
              events, such as posters, videos, and tickets. I also ran lights and
              sound for majority of school events.</p>
            <p>As a Social Coordinator, I organized brief events to host on
              important occasions, such as holiday weeks, during school hours.</p>

          <p>I was approved entry into the Regional Youth Council in January 2017

            Waterloo region.</p>
          <p>Our work is delegated into 3 main subtopics: the Youth
            Initiative, Indigenous Rights, and Regional Sustainability.<p>

              directing an initiative to advocate for free busing for high school
              students in the Waterloo region. To accomplish this I have met with
              representatives from the Grand River Transit, and sat down with
              notable figures in the region to determine the optimal way to
              incentivise youth to utilize the bus system and encourage students
              to be more aware of their ecological footprint.</p>

          <p>"Fed-Prov" allows high schools in the Kitchener Waterloo region to assume
            the role of a Province, Territory, or interest group in Canada. They
            meet at the University of Waterloo annually to discuss prevalent issues
            facing Canadians today from our role's perspective. Each year I acted in
            a different position, and have served in significant leadership
            positions for three of my years.</p>
          <p>For my work as the leader of the Canadian Taxpayer Federation in the
            50th annual conference I recieved the <strong>Outstanding Delegate
            Award</strong>. In the following year, as the Premier of Saskatchewan,
            I recieved the <strong>John Boulden Award for Outstanding Premier
            </strong>.</p>

            <p>In my first year on FedProv, I participated in the Indigenous Affairs
              debate as part of the delegation of Nova Scotia. The debate was
              primarily focused on the missing and murdered indigenous women inquiry.</p>
            <p>On my second year, I served as the head of Public Relations for the
              delegation of Alberta. Here, I collaborated with local press groups
              by writing articles from the perspective of the Albertan government.</p>
            <p>During my third conference, I was selected to lead a special interest
              group, known as the Canadian Taxpayer Federation. My role was to
              advocate against governent overspending and poor budgeting.
              We were not given much time in the spotlight so we needed to find
              unique ways of publicizing our opinions. We succeeded through managing
              an active social media page, developing multimedia advertisement, and
              delivering public speeches. </p>
            <p>In my final conference, I was selected to represent the Premier of
              Saskatchewan, and therefore lead the Saskatchewan delegation. I was
              required to organzie my team of 30 students into various debate
              groups, draft position papers on behalf of my delegation, and
              prepare each delegate for their upcoming debate. I also coordinated
              a social media page and delivered opening and closing speeches
              during the conference. I debated within the First Ministers meeting,
              where prevalent issues such as Reform of the Anti-terrorism act,
              Formalization of the Federal Spending Power, developing a Transparent
              Framework for Review of Future Energy Projects, and Electoral Reform
              were discussed.

            online and in-class simulation where students are given a hidden
