          <h2>Developer and Automation Specialist - Mach7 Technologies</h2>
          <p>My most recent co-op term was with Mach7 Technologies, where I was once again given
            the opportunity to contribute to the medical field. Here, I attained skill in Dart application
            development, and created my own Javascript API to conduct performance tests on a clinical viewer.
          </p>
            <h4><a href="#hiddenproj0" data-toggle="collapse" id="hide">Click here to

          <div id="hiddenproj0" class="collapse">
            <p>My main goal for this term was to fully develop a Javascript API responsible for 
              conducting frame rate performance tests on cinematics within an embedded viewer.
              Through this project, I developed asynchronous functions for sampling frame rates from multiple
              queried video instances, and wrote parsing utilities to translate the obtained data into results
              which could be compared to generated baseline documents to catch regressions in performance.
              I developed performance tests to recognize variance in functionality across multiple configurations of Webassembly,
              and different render engines.
            </p>
            <p>I also contributed to an internal API for DICOM markups, to allow the creation, deletion, and querying of spine labeling markups in specific studies through console commands. These utilities
              are included in a PostMessage API which is interactable using external windows. Both APIs required testing infrastructure to be constructed as well, using Selenium for automation tasks.
              Creating the tests for API functionalities included generating anonymized DICOM studies,  proper parsing of responses from each API, and the development of unique tools necessary to validate behaviour.

          <h2>Developer and Test Specialist - Client Outlook Inc.</h2>
          <p>After transferring to Computer Engineering, I was given an extra couple of co-op terms, 
            which I am proud to have spent at Client Outlook Inc. Here, I have had the opportunity to create my own Dart applications
            from the ground up, develop PostMessage APIs for a medical viewer, and maintain Maven automation suites to validate viewer performance. 
          </p>
          <h4><a href="#hiddenproj1" data-toggle="collapse" id="hide">Click here to

          <div id="hiddenproj1" class="collapse">
            <p>In this position, I developed a Dart API for creating and manipulating DICOM markups in a clinical viewer through external applications. 
              This involved the use of notification handlers, visitor patterns, and PostMessage requests. The API was initially written using ActionScript, and
              subsequently converted to Dart. With the commands introduced by this internal API, users could create, remove and query a number of unique markups with extreme precision.
              Extra care went into validation of the utility, given its usage in the medical field by external, third-party applications.</p>
            <p>I was also tasked with contributing to and maintaining a series of Maven automation suites to run on a nightly basis. This involved using Groovy to script a Jenkins pipeline,
              and Selenium to conduct the required tests. I developed many utilities for the automation suites, including tools necessary for performing screen layout validations, updating preferences, 
              and triangulation.</p>
            <p>At Client Outlook, I contributed to a clinical viewer product in compliance with its PureMVC architecture. When I was not enhancing internal APIs, fixing bugs, or developing additional utilities,
              I also took part in regression testing prior to each product release.</p>
            <p>One of my favourite projects I was assigned at Client Outlook was the creation of an external Dart application to control an embedded clinical viewer using PostMessage commands. I was tasked with modeling
              each component of the application, from conceptualizing the UI using wireframes, to full implementation. The application could distinguish commands from multiple origins, and conduct necessary actions in the
              embedded viewer.</p>

          <h2>Hardware Developer - Canadian Tire Innovations</h2>
          <p>My second work term took me to the Canadian Tire Digital Innovation Lab at the Communitech Hub. 
            Here, I honed my hardware development skills by building a robotic retail solution to optimize 
            shelf space and provide fast customer transactions for seasonal items. This position helped me 
            achieve adeptability in robotics development, through circuit fabrication, memory-efficient programming,
            and 3D printing.</p>

            <p>I worked as part of a small, multidisciplinary team to prototype a product retrieval system.
              My primary designation, as a hardware developer, was to construct the frame for the machine, and implement
              a functional gantry system including a programmable robotic arm.</p>
            <p>I drafted components for many robotic system prototypes, using Solidworks for 3D printed 
              components and AutoCAD for laser cutting templates. I had the opportunity to get my hands dirty as well, 
            using a milling machine, miter saw, and table saw for more intricate components. What we could not easily make, 
            we had to source from local aluminum providers. Sourcing aluminum extrusions, brackets, actuators, and microcontrollers
            has taught me a great deal about product management and self-reliance.</p>
            <p>My favourite opporunity from this job was to construct and program a three-dimensional gantry, including a robotic arm 
              for retrieving products from coordinated locations. The entirety of the system was powered using an Arduino, which I had ported 
              FreeRTOS onto in order to multitask axial movement. I coded an acceleration profile for each of the gantry rails to ensure that
              stress on the included motors was minimized. Each gantry rail was controlled through PWM, which, using additional drivers, 
              could translate the gantry to a precise postion. I was also required to make drastic modifications to the robotic arm's API
              for precise product retrieval.</p>
            <p>This job was one of my first experiences with C, and  taught me some fundamentals of concurrency, interrupts, multitasking, and I/O.</p>

          <h2>Robot Process Automation Developer - The Co-operators</h2>
          <p>For my first work term, I joined the Co-operators at their
          Kitchener Development Incubator to automate user processes and create
          communication channels between virtual robots and their users. Through
          this position I had the chance to explore server communication,
          databases and Artificial Intelligence.</p>

            <p>Through the position, I leanred the inner workings of Node.js, VB.NET,
            C# and SQL. Work was accomplished using an Agile Sprint system.</p>
            <p>I was given the opportunity to explore the Google Visual
            Recognition API when investivating the development of an AI bot.
            As well, I gained hands-on experience developing with the MS Bot
            Framework as I contructed a chat-bot which would receive and send
            questions and answers between a user and a virtual robot. I implemented
            a user-input verification system such that questions could specify
            what type of answer would be acceptable. Commands were implemented
            to improve user navigation and assistance. A waterfall dialog system
            was added as well to avoid having to hardcode any prompts, and thus
            the entire solution was completely modular and could work with any
            other solutions the company may devise in the future.</p>
            <p>Communication was done through a server I constructed, which
            would not only hold information as JSON at endpoints but also
            timestamp and store data inside an MS SQL database. To accomplish
            this, a REST API was written to easily send queries to the DB.</p>
            <p>Lastly a script was written for a virtual robot to execute in the
            VB.NET language. The bot would access internal services and apply
            data obtained from the server to existing fields. Code was
            thoroughly tested to ensure durability and longevity.</p>

          <p>EngHack is an annual hackathon held at the University of Waterloo for
            students to experiment with a multitude of hardware and software and
            attempt to build inventive solutions to real-world problems. My team
            opted to tackle the issue of home security and hone our hardware
            skills with <strong>Eagle Eye</strong>. We built a portable sensor
            box that transmits movement and audio data to a webservice for a
            user to view. The goal of the project is to help users monitor
            break-ins on their property.</p>

            <p>Our team wired and machined a small portable arduino-powered box,
            which was equipped with audio and motion sensors. If any unusual
            patterns were detected, the microcontroller would transmit serialized
            data from the sensors to an additional arduino attached to the
            user's computer, which was received through a Processing script.
            The data would then be displayed on a web-page.</p>
            <p>As well, work was done in creating a machine learning algorithm
            to determine user intention based on audio captured. A script was

          <h2>Civics Club - Co-Founder</h2>
          <p>I co-founded this club as a means of promoting political engagement in
            the student body. In the club, a game of Civic Mirror was played, an
            online and in-class simulation where students are given a hidden
            political agenda and must accomplish their goals. I received a lot of
            positive feedback from club members, saying the club has encouraged them
            to remain politically aware.</p>
          <p>I am happy to say that the Civics Club has outlived my time at
            high school and is currently being run by other successors at
            Bluevale Collegiate.</p>

          <h2>Bluevale's Grads as Gophers</h2>
          <p>Grads as Gophers is a Bluevale tradition where a group of graduates
            are auctioned off as servants to grade nines for a week as a means of
            raising money for prom. The role entailed the development, choreography
            and performance of a musical number during the auction, and
            performing daily tasks for the grade nines, such as carrying them to
            class, buying them lunch, and helping them with homework.</p>

          <h2>Local Performer and Musician</h2>
          <p>I take vocal lessons at Russell Music Studios, where I study music
            theory and singing techniques. Since last year, I have regularly performed at
            coffee house shows hosted by the studio. I sing and play
            guitar, performing songs ranging from jazz, punk rock, and pop.</p>
          <p>I have also performed in the annual Next Up! Showcase by IdeasExchange,
            and performed at the Cambridge City Hall for their Person's Day showcase.</p>
          <p>I also regularly produce electronic music which I put on
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCSgRAdM8rYguBVuFUCGPMQ"

          <h2>Bluevale Mock Trial Club</h2>
          <p>As a lawyer on the Mock Trial team, I represented clients in a court
            simulation as both a Crown and Defense attorney. This required me to
            research and collect evidence for both sides of the prepared case, while
            developing lines of questioning for my witnesses. Our team won the Regional
            Mock Trial Competition and participated in the Greater Toronto Area Mock
            Trial Competition.</p>
